# Fastest-presser-game
This is a simple fun game where two users compete about who can press a key the most times within a set time!
A user specifies how long time the game should be, and presses "start game!".
It is about pressing either 'L' or 'S' on the keyboard. 
The user that has the highest number of keypresses after the time is up, wins.
